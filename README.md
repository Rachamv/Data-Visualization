# Data-Visualization
Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.

In the Data Visualization Certification, I'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.

I'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).

## Data Visualization with D3
D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, I'll transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, I'll learn how to work with data to create different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.

I'll ...
* Add Document Elements with D3

* Add Classes with D3
 
* Update the Height of an Element Dynamically
 
* Change the Presentation of a Bar Chart
 
* Learn About SVG in D3
 
* Display Shapes with SVG
 
* Create a Bar for Each Data Point in the Set
 
* Dynamically Set the Coordinates for Each Bar
 
Dynamically Change the Height of Each Bar

Use a Pre-Defined Scale to Place Elements
 
Add Axes to a Visualization

JSON APIs and AJAX
Similar to how UIs help people use programs, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help programs interact with other programs. APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data.

Programmers often use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) when working with APIs. AJAX refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. And the data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

This course will teach you the basics about working with APIs and different AJAX technologies in the browser.

Data Visualization Projects
Now that you learned how to work with D3, APIs, and AJAX technologies, put your skills to the test with these 5 Data Visualization projects.

In these projects, you'll need to fetch data and parse a dataset, then use D3 to create different data visualizations. Finish them all to earn your Data Visualization certification.
